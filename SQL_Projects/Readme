# Grocery Sales SQL Analysis Project

This project analyzes sales data from a grocery store database using SQL. It includes 10 business-focused questions designed to demonstrate advanced SQL skills, such as:

✅ Complex joins across multiple tables  
✅ Aggregations and grouping  
✅ HAVING filters  
✅ Window functions (where applicable)  
✅ Use of `TOP`, `OFFSET FETCH`, and subqueries

## Dataset Overview

The database consists of six tables:
- CUSTOMER: Customer details, including balances
- DEPARTMENT: Store departments
- EMPLOYEE: Employee details and their departments
- ITEM: Items sold, categories, prices, and stock levels
- ORDERS: Order dates, customers, and employees processing them
- SALEITEM: Order line items, quantities sold, and sale prices

## Key Insights Generated

- Identified top-spending customers exceeding $500 in purchases  
- Determined the best-selling item and category by total revenue  
- Found the city generating the highest sales revenue  
- Calculated average order value  
- Listed employees with the highest order processing volumes  
- Highlighted items selling more than 100 units  
- Identified days with highest sales  
- Ranked customers with largest outstanding balances  
- Filtered customers based on purchase behavior using HAVING clause  
- Used advanced sorting and limiting techniques (e.g., `TOP`, `OFFSET FETCH`)

## How to Use
