🍽 Dynamic Inventory Optimization — Capstone Project

As part of my ITM900 capstone at Toronto Metropolitan University, I analyzed Akash Chaat House’s operations and recommended a modern inventory management system to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and optimize stock levels.

📌 Project Highlights
✅ Conducted in-depth business analysis of the restaurant’s processes.  
✅ Documented existing workflows and identified key inefficiencies causing up to 15% inventory loss.  
✅ Proposed a digital inventory management solution to enable real-time tracking, automate reordering, and generate reports.  
✅ Created detailed requirements, business process models (BPMN), ER diagrams, class and sequence diagrams, and a risk management plan.
